Besides adopting the GoogleCast SDK to access content on the TV, developers can make use of Androids Presentation API (via Miracast) to utilize the TV as an additional screen or use the Anymote protocol to gain full control over Google TV devices right from within their apps. This talk will take a look at all three approaches, compare them and give some details on how to make use of them in your Android app."
