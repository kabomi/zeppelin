Melinda Albert is going to explain you in 40 minutes how you could bring more delightful details in your user interface, make your product more memorable so that it attracts new customers.\n\nThese are some of the questions which are included and going to be answered during the session: What are delightful details and how can we cluster them? Are colors and icons enought to create a brand identity? How can we achieve a visually memorable product that user remember and love? "

Even if there's only scarce documentation for it, the Canvas API is at the heart of everything that shows a UI on Android. You'll need to tame this powerful and mysterious creature if you want to create great custom views and brilliant, lightweight UIs for your apps. What is a Canvas? How do you Paint? Can you draw Paths? What is Skia, and who invited it anyway? What actualy happens during a drawing pass? What are Shaders? What are Filters? Is it true that text is basically impossible to measure correctly? What shape does a Shape have if noone's painting it? These and other questions will get an answer during this session. Well, some of them will not, probably. Connect the dots in the spotty documentation the Android team has assembled, and become a true pixel pusher!"

  description: "Most of us Android developers are able to build awesome apps, but do we really know how the Android OS works? In some cases, as when developing a new product, adding customised apps is not enough, and OS modifications are required. From downloading the source code, to where to touch and modify it, to the (technical) process for placing it on your device. We will explore the world of Google's Repo and its collection of git repositories. The attendees will be able to customize the Android OS to address the needs of a new product, editing some features normally hidden to normal apps."

  title: Using the web for music production and for live performances
  place: casino

  description: "The introduction of the Web Audio API has enriched the web landscape enormously. It gives game developers the ability to add precisely timed, high performant sound effects and to create realistic spatialized sound landscapes. For many web developers it is the first time they encounter audio programming which leads to many interesting experiments when the world of web and audio collide. Traditional web developers start to become really interested into audio programming and educate themselves on the topic of synthesizers and audio effects. However, currently there are only few applications that try to create audio production or audio performance environments in the browser. In this talk I want to show how the Web Audio API can be used to create a collaborative music production environment similar to Garageband. Furthermore, I will do a live demonstration of a music performance setup which is inspired by The Glitch Mobâs setup (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bXNo9MFXnU). Both demos will show how powerful the Web Audio API is and how important the web can become as platform for music production in the future."
