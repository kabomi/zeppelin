This procedure has been adopted from the Ada Initiative's guide titled "[Conference anti-harassment/Responding to Reports](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Responding_to_reports)”.

1\. Keep in mind that all conference staff will be wearing a conference t-shirt/button with the word “STAFF”
on it (or otherwise clearly marked as staff). The staff will also be prepared to handle the incident.
All of our staff are informed of the [code of conduct policy](../) and guide
for handling harassment at the conference. *There will be a mandatory staff meeting onsite at the conference
when this will be reiterated.*

2\. Report the harassment incident (preferably in writing) to a conference staff member. All reports
are confidential. Please do not disclose public information about the incident until the staff have
had sufficient time in which to address the situation. This is as much for your safety and protection
as it is the other attendees.

When reporting the event to staff, try to gather as much information as available but do not
interview people about the incident. Staff will assist you in writing the report/collecting information.

The important information consists of:

- Identifying information (name/badge number) of the participant doing the harassing
- The behavior that was in violation
- The approximate time of the behavior (if different than the time the report was made)
- The circumstances surrounding the incident
- Other people involved in the incident

The staff is well informed on how to deal with the incident and how to further proceed with the situation.

3\. If everyone is presently physically safe, involve law enforcement or security only at a victim's request.
If you do feel your safety in jeopardy please do not hesitate to contact local law enforcement by
dialing 110. If you do not have a cell phone, you can use any hotel phone or simply ask a staff member.

**Note**: Incidents that violate the Code of Conduct are extremely damaging to the community, and they
will not be tolerated. The silver lining is that, in many cases, these incidents present a chance for
the offenders, and the community at large, to grow, learn, and become better. DevFest staff requests
that they be your first resource when reporting a DevFest-related incident, so that they may enforce
the Code of Conduct and take quick action toward a resolution.

A listing of [DevFest staff is located here](../../team/).
If at all possible, all reports should be made directly to [Stefan Hoth](mailto:stefan@devfest-berlin.de) or [Hasan Hosgel](mailto:hasan@devfest-berlin.de).
